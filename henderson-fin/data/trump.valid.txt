The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks... 
Now that Obama's poll numbers are in tailspin - watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate. 
Mitt's subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner. 
In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts you need to know about real estate. - Think Like a Billionaire

Welcome to Obama's America--record high poverty and an 8 percent drop in median household family income Four more years?  
.@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama who put these radicals in power deserves blame. 
Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll 
It's Thursday how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?  
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?  
I will be speaking Monday September 24 10 A.M. at Liberty University to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!  
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney. 
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9 11 to attack our embassies. 
With allies like Egypt and Libya who needs enemies? !  
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9 11?  
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak. 
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates. 
Wake Up America!  See article: Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake 
If Obama was smart he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't. 
Romney's campaign is being put on the defensive. He cannot let this happen. Stop pandering. Must get tougher cont 
With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food. 
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had. 
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble. 
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President. 
Weakness cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President. 
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. -- Vince Lombardi 
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013. 
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. ObamaequalsCarter. 
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?  
Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel. -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu 
No surprise. @DNC displayed Russian ships in tribute to vets Did they mean to honor the Russians?  
Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy. 
It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic cont 
So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres. Morsi in the White House but doesn't have time for @netanyahu?  
OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off. 
It's Wednesday how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?  
What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil. 
As bad as they were I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power. 
The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace cont 
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job. 
Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe. 
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again I was right. 
Obama doesn't know what he's doing. His foreign policy is a disaster. Libya Egypt Iraq Afghanistan--all cont 
An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil. We have been attacked by Libya. Go into Libya and take the cont 
We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans. Obama's foreign policy is a joke. 
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election?  The day after. 
Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' Complete waste. We need the best and easiest fuel for our military. 
I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time. 
There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare. -- Sun Tzu 
If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party. -- @limbaugh 
Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base. 
Priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime Obama has skipped over 50 percent of his intel briefings 
China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands 
Why won't Obama release his college applications?  Is there something 'foreign' about them?  
84 percent of US troops wounded and 70 percent of our brave men and women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there. 
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration?  Where's the media?  
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers and their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school. 
On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.

My @SquawkCNBC  #TrumpTuesday interview with Ken Langone and Dick Grasso discussing the Chicago teachers' strike @ 2012 
Discussing the 9 11 attack and coverage with @kingsthings while hosting the 25th anniversary of his @CNN show 
An impromptu interview I did with German TV on 9 11 down by Ground Zero discussing the attack and WTC Towers 
Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago. 
Obama called August's job report progress. Overall 96K new jobs and over 173K new people on food 
You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.--General George S. Patton 
Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background?  Who is he?  
Barack Obama used to mock Bush's 300K monthly job reports Now Obama wishes he could have a month half as good. 
President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people--Clint Eastwood 
Obama asked a 7 yr old for his birth certificate. He's in your face because the Republicans dropped the ball. cont 
In today's  #trumpvlog I speak about Clint Eastwood the  #DNC and Drew Peterson- 
You have enemies?  Good. That means you've stood up for something sometime in your life. -- Winston Churchill 
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!  
One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage. 
During @BarackObama's presidency median family income has fallen 4.8 percent Terrible for the middle class. 
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence go with your gut!  
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2 percent 
This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: Disaster. 
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force and have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery phony numbers 
There are now 119 000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible. 
Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88 921 000 Americans are no longer in the work force. 
Drew Peterson a real sleaze just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty. 
Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!  
The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney. 
The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants @GiulianaRancic and me singing Call Me Maybe has over 2M views. 
Under @BarackObama 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps. 
Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6 percent of America's history he has amassed 33.3 percent of the total debt. 
We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion -- @MittRomney 
Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people. --@MittRomney 
The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!  
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. 
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released. 
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting Four More Years. Four more years of 18 percent real unemployment and another $6T in debt?  
Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient. 
.@BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention 
Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign 
Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you United States for making this possible!  
Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?  
Once again under@BarackObama the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness We must do better. 
Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!  
Change before you have to. --Jack Welch 
Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte?  Did he bring his phone with him?  
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!  
Have you seen the new  #TRUMP line of clothing apparel and fragrances @Macy's?  Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts etc. 
Better off?  The $16T US debt works out to $136 260 per household a 50 percent increase since @BarackObama took office. 
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte. 
I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now. 
Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late Show. It's simple--I get the ratings!  
.@serenawilliams is a special player. After winning the Gold for the US in the Olympics it looks like she will cont 
With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday it was ironic that the debt passed $16T. 
.@lancearmstrong revise your decision to quit--go back and fight. 
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon @lancearmstrong for events that took place years ago in France?  
.@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance. 
Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!  
No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans Big mistake!  
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year. 
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?  
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous!  
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs and trade during @BarackObama's term. 
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94 percent @BarackObama 0 percent @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism?  
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary. 
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us. 
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info. 
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote. 
Is this Hope and Change?  A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better. 
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane?  He is more than welcomed to come for a ride. 
Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report. 
Be yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected. -- Steve Jobs 
As I predicted 1 year ago gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense. 
Great going Andy Roddick!  Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck. 
I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!

@MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces and Jewelry. Tune in at 1AM EST!  
Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?  
Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife. 
Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!  
China is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade They stole the technology from us. 
.@BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China. --@MittRomney 
I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore. 
We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran. 
.@GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night. People love him. 
Obama's ideas don't move us 'Forward ' they take us 'Backwards.' These are ideas people come to America to get away from. --@marcorubio 
.@MittRomney's entire life and career have built prosperity and growth. 
I loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific!  
If you accept the expectations of others especially negative ones then you will never change the outcome. -- Michael Jordan 
Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this. 
It's Friday how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?  
A fact--golfers don't get aches and pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial. 
Of course @hardball chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it. 
Letterman @Late Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment. 
Too busy playing golf?  @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic signature to the parents of fallen SEALs 
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President. 
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie. 
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate. 
After four years of getting the run-around America needs a turnaround and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. @PaulRyanVP 
The dummies left Iraq and Libya without the oil!  
Let me say it as clearly as possible that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. -- @GovMike Huckabee 
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better. 
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year. 
Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand how do OPEC and the speculators get away with this? !  
Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden 
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?  
I was putting together my early deals in New York and I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself and you can do anything. 
China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough. 
I am astonished that the media continues to lie. @BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!  
America needs @MittRomney and @PaulRyanVP and we need them right now. -- @GovChristie 
No one will work harder. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live!  -- @AnnDRomney

Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can't wait to call her our First Lady. 
An excerpt of my @TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota 'Statesman of the Year' dinner discussing the Tea Party 
China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama. 
What a coincidence--Michelle Obama called Kenya @BarackObama's homeland in 2008 
.@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November. 
I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors. 
I can't wait to read this...RT @Newsmax Media: SEAL Book Explodes Obama Furious 
.@BarackObama's Super PAC has continually called @MittRomney a murderer Ironic since Obama is destroying Medicare. 
I stand ready to lead us down a new path where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed not by a resentment of success. -- @MittRomney 
It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?  
.@GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney should be elected and @BarackObama has to go. 
.@MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight. She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady!

.@FinancialTimes writes that @BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US Don't worry he is making it happen. 
The US Navy wants to go green. Our Navy should use the best and most powerful fuel and not play games. Give me a break!  
As usual the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines and ratings!  
Media silent when @BarackObama called @MittRomney a murderer and felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!

One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire.
