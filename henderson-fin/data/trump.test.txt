The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya. 
Our worst threat to unemployment is @ObamaCare. It will also destroy our country's basic standards. 
When will our nation's sacrifices be respectfully appreciated?  Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil. 
The Debt is our nation's greatest threat. @BarackObama is out of touch. 
Watch me tonight at 9PM ET on @CNN full hour. @Piersmorgan won @ApprenticeNBC before taking over Larry King's slot- should be interesting. 
Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave?  We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake. 
When will Washington stand up to China. China is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. Washington should move on legislation.

We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. We should be reimbursed with oil!  -- Don't give it to Iran.

Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors?  Iran is a threat to our national security. 
A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector. 
Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil?  What do we get out of this?  
Why is crude oil priced at $86 Barrel?  OPEC is ripping us off. Not worth $30 Barrel. America needs new leaders.

The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly. 
We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline. 
Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things 
Ronald Kessler's new book The Secrets of the FBI is a great book that should be read by everyone. 
Increasing America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. - US Senator @BarackObama 2007 
My interview on @gretawire last night - Our Leaders Are Leading Us Into 'Oblivion' 
The Gang of Six - yet another unmitigated disaster. ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. T-E-A. 
China is our enemy--they want to destroy us -- Redstate Interview 
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it. 
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly. 
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy our credit our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President. 
@johnboehner @EricCantor You can't con people...if you don't deliver the goods people will eventually catch on. - The Art of the Deal 
So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk?  
The GOP doesn't waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal. 
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!  
@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd Amendment rights. 
 #trumpvlog The Republicans must act now don't let @barackobama push you around.... 
Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday. 
@marcorubio is right. We need to create more taxpayers not more taxes. CUT CAP AND BALANCE. 
@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25 percent annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. T-E-A 
Who will be the next @TheRealTeenUSA?  Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa.com  #TeenUSA 
What is better advice- The Art of the Deal or Rules for Radicals?  I know which one @BarackObama prefers. 
CUT CAP AND BALANCE. TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY!  
Take a look at and to see these beautiful hotels. 
US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US--and Trump Int'l Hotel and Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel and Tower Chicago are on the list!  
@BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood and even the Arab world does not like it 
While @BarackObama tries to push gun control --He still has not answered for Project Gun Runner 
My interview last night with Greta on the GOP going El Foldo 
@johnboehner Debt Ceiling- Sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal. 
More thoughts on the debt ceiling in today's  #trumpvlog... 
@macmiller Donald Trump the Song gets 16M hits on YouTube. Who wouldn't be flattered?  
@johnboehner Much as it pays to emphasize the positive there are times when the only choice is confrontation. The Art of the Deal

House GOP wants to cut Medicare Obama took $500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare. Both Wrong!  
ObamaCare Tragedy Primed to Further Explode the Deficit And @Obama transferred $500 billion from Medicare to fund it!  
@Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq?  What are u doing about this?  
@johnboehner Message for House GOP The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. - The Art of the Deal. 
If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency. 
THe Art of the Deal--The best thing you can do is deal from strength and leverage is the biggest strength you have. CUT CAP and BALANCE. 
Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUT CAP and BALANCE. 
Congress is back.TIME TO CUT CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. 
Perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in Washington ... 
Tomorrow we'll be going to Panama for the opening of our new hotel. It's a fantastic building in a fantastic location. 
Wishing everyone a wonderful Independence Day holiday weekend a great celebration for a great country.
